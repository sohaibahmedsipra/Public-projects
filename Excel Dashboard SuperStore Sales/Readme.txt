About the dashboard:
✓ First of all, the dashboard includes a bar chart for the top 10 best performing products in a given time period.
✓ Secondly, you can view the order density by region.
✓ Thirdly, a waterfall chart shows the most used shipping modes.
✓ Next, the orders per year (divided by segments) are displayed in a column chart.
✓ Lastly, the filters can be used to filter on the basis of years, regions and categories.

The dashboard can be helpful in visualizing the performance of a store.
